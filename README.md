# Register Machine

## Overview

The Register Machine project is a simple implementation of a register-based virtual machine. This project aims to simulate the behavior of a basic register machine, which can be used for educational purposes to understand low-level machine operations and instruction execution.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Register manipulation (load, store)
- Indirect register manipulation
- Conditional operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/PowerVerox/registermaschine.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd registermaschine/src
    ```

### Usage

1. Create a program file with instructions for the register machine.
2. Run the register machine with the program file as input:
    ```sh
    python3 main.py
    ```
